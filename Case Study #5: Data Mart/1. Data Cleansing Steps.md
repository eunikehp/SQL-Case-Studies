## 1. Data Cleansing Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named ```clean_weekly_sales```:

1. Convert the week_date to a DATE format
2. Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
3. Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
4. Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
5. Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

|segment|	age_band|
|---|---|
|1	|Young Adults|
|2	|Middle Aged|
|3 or 4	|Retirees|

6. Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:

|segment	|demographic|
|---|---|
|C	|Couples|
|F|	Families|

7. Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns
